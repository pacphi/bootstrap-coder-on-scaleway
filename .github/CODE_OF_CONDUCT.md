# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Being respectful and inclusive** in language and actions
* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being open to constructive feedback** and learning from mistakes
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language** in all communications
* **Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences** from community members
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism** and different approaches to problem-solving
* **Showing courtesy and respect** toward community members at all skill levels

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment of any form
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking someone based on their level of experience or background
* Gatekeeping or making others feel unwelcome based on their technical knowledge
* Persistent unwelcome contact or communication
* Any other conduct that creates an unwelcoming or hostile environment

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project email address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Participating in project-related forums, mailing lists, or chat channels
* Contributing code, documentation, or other materials to the project
* Participating in issue discussions, pull request reviews, or community discussions

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces when they negatively affect community members' safety, well-being, or participation in the community.

## Community Guidelines

### Creating an Inclusive Environment

We strive to create an environment where:

* **All backgrounds are welcome**: We value contributors from all technical backgrounds, career stages, and personal experiences
* **Questions are encouraged**: No question is too basic or too advanced - we're all here to learn and grow
* **Multiple perspectives are valued**: Different approaches to solving problems make our project stronger
* **Mistakes are learning opportunities**: We all make mistakes, and they're chances to improve together
* **Collaboration over competition**: We succeed together by helping each other succeed

### Technical Discussions

When engaging in technical discussions:

* **Be constructive**: Focus on the idea or code, not the person
* **Provide context**: Help others understand your reasoning and approach
* **Be patient**: Allow time for others to respond and consider different perspectives
* **Ask clarifying questions**: Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
* **Share knowledge**: Help others learn by explaining concepts and sharing resources

### Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

* **Address issues directly**: Speak with the person involved before escalating
* **Focus on the issue**: Keep discussions about specific problems, not personal attributes
* **Seek understanding**: Try to understand different perspectives and find common ground
* **Be willing to compromise**: Look for solutions that work for everyone involved
* **Know when to step back**: Take breaks from heated discussions when needed

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

* Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
* Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
* Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate
